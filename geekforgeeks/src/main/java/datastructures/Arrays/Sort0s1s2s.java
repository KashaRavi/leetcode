/**
 * I did not go through the solution but the idea is In the first cycle(iteration) segrate 0s into left partition and
 * (1s and 2s) into second partition.
 * In the second cycle segrate 2nd partition further into 2 partions of 1s and 2s.
 * The resulting array should have all the elements in sorted order.
