/**
 * The solution is needs pointers one running from left to right and the other one running from
 * right to left. The left should skip all the even numbers and moves forward until it encounters an odd number
 * The right one skips all the odd numbers and moves backward unitl it finds an even number. Then swap the
 * values at left pointer and right pointer.
